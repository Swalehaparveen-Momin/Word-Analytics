# Word-Analytics

**Description**
Fancy Counter is a JavaScript-based counter that adds a touch of style to your webpage. It provides functionality for both incrementing and decrementing a counter with certain constraints.

**Points to Remember**
1. The counter should increment up to 5 only. If it exceeds the upper limit, the plus button should be disabled, and the top label text should be changed accordingly.
2. The counter decrement should not result in a negative value.
